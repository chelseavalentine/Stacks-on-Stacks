# Stacks on Stacks

A Chrome extension for Stackoverflow. It works in the background, saving your Stackoverflow tabs so that you can go back to questions any time you want. Let's face it, 99% of coding is Stackoverflow'ing, therefore this extension will make you 99% better. We'll release the "final" version soon after finals.

If you know how to install unpacked Chrome extensions, you can feel free to pull our repo and begin using it. If you don't know how to, you should probably Stackoverflow it. We'll add a mini-guide later.
