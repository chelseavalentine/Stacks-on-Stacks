# Stacked

Key features:

- auto-add links and replaces with "question-title"
- delete button
- should not have repeats of links
- timer for 2-hr block
- allow graphical UI for user to move around
- allow user to name each collection

Possible problems:

- HTML5 Storage only allocates 5MB for each origin, so unless there's a backend to the plugin, it might get hard to manage when the amount of links get big
