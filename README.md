### Next steps:

* Add a new link on every load (done in custom.js)
* Add the top answer to each object

	* Change our icon from a poop *[side-eyes julie]*



Key features:

- timer for 2-hr block
- allow graphical UI for user to drag stuff
- concept of links as Collections
- allow user to name each collection
- allow key strokes to navigate through the links (one button to open/close, a few to navigate, press enter to open link)
